If you see this error after compiling the code:

Error 175: The ADO.NET provider with invariant name 'System.Data.SQLite' is either not registered in the machine or application config file, or could not be loaded. See the inner exception for details. (DAL/ExinEf.edmx)

Than you need to download and install the corresponding version of the SQLite .NET Provider from here:
