* The Amount numeric field is problematic...

* ConnectionStrings in the system: config files exist, but they are not in use in the ExinConnectionString already and yet. They've been removed already, and not reapplied yet.
** We won't need to manually read this config file, the ConfigurationManager will fit. This way, every App.config file has to have the config file's location; but that's the same - and changless - everywhere. So we story the ConnectionString data in 1 place.
*** BTW, the .csproj files have to be modified in the .exe projects; we have to set these files to be copied.
**** TODO write memo for this
  <Target Name="AfterBuild">
    <Copy SourceFiles="..\Common\Common\bin\$(Configuration)\Config\ConnectionStrings.config" DestinationFolder="$(TargetDir)Config\" />
  </Target>

Implement MainSettings.xml and RepoSettings.xml things
* CopyFormat
* Currency
* LastInitVersion
* localization to config error messages (because they would appear on ui)
* TransportData: How should it work in the new system?
** Currently can't work from VS in Release mode (but that's not a problem)
** TransportData: Currently does not run from VS, only from WPF/bin/.. (because of the MainSettings.xml location)
* Starting problem with MainSettings.xml: If a new, virgin app starts, it will crash on the RepoRoot validation
** Started to fix this, but still need testing

NOTE: We may rename Common/Config folder, we copy the files in it manually on PostBuild

TEST TransportData when the args From and To are both DB types

* ExinConnString: Next level of configurability: Managers should have 1 instance, which they could take also in ctor
** RepoPaths: no more static
* InitAllStatic
* Currency
* SQLiteSpecific.cs uses Config.Repo. Is it ok so?
