Implement MainSettings.xml and RepoSettings.xml things
* Language
* CopyFormat
* AllowsFutureDate
* Read (possibly multiple) repositorties from here, with their configuration
** CurrentRepoNames
* (currency)
* StatYAxisMax
* LastInitVersion

* Eliminate WPF/Config/... AppSettings.config and ConnectionStrings.config. Use the new xml files instead
* Search for "ConfigurationManager.AppSettings" usages

TEST TransportData when the args From and To are both DB types

* ExinConnString: Next level of configurability: Managers should have 1 instance, which they could take also in ctor
** RepoPaths: no more static
* InitAllStatic
* Currency
* SQLiteSpecific.cs uses Config.Repo. Is it ok so?
