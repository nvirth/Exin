Implement MainSettings.xml and RepoSettings.xml things
* CopyFormat
* Currency
* LastInitVersion

* Go back WPF/Config/ConnectionStrings.config; but parse it manually instead of the ConfigurationManager class
* localization to config error messages (because they would appear on ui)
* TransportData: Currently does not run from VS, only from WPF/bin/.. (because of the MainSettings.xml location)

---
TEST TransportData when the args From and To are both DB types

* ExinConnString: Next level of configurability: Managers should have 1 instance, which they could take also in ctor
** RepoPaths: no more static
* InitAllStatic
* Currency
* SQLiteSpecific.cs uses Config.Repo. Is it ok so?
