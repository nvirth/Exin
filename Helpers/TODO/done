TODO ManagerFactory -> aggregates + dao interfaces
TODO search for word "Instance" in the managers to discover their dependecies on each other
TODO implement SummaryItemManagerFileRepo.InsertOrUpdateSummary
TODO TransactionItemManager.GetDaily(...IncomeItem) -> Do not get the IncomeItems this way! Get them from monthly
TODO ImportDataToDb todos
TODO markers
TODO Unit Unit_lowercase
TODO NameSpace refactor

* Bring Managers to common interface
** Config.Repo.ReadMode/SaveMode is worthy for a search

(1)
Fns to extend:
ISummaryItemManagerDao.ReplaceSummary
ITransactionItemManagerDao.ReplaceDailyExpenses
ITransactionItemManagerDao.ReplaceMonthlyIncomes
--> Maybe they are better this way. This way they always recalculate the Summary object; but at least it will be always fresh before saving them into Repo. So GUI made errors can be eliminated - or hope so
(2)
ManagerReliefs in Common -> Eliminate. Instead, move UiModels and DbEnties into DAL. It does not sounds good, but the truth is, those classes are largly merged together with DAL managers (I mean the UiModels; the DbEntities are ok merged)
--> Not better...
