DataBinding to a ComboBox - in a master-detail situation - is complicated.
First, with the designer, use the smart tag. ("DataBinding to ComboBox - 1.png" ). Here "Data Source" is the master collection, which from the SelectedItem will come. DisplayMember is the property path of the displayable member. Value member is empty - here, we have used a complex type (Category), and we wanted to compare these to each by reference (or by the object itself; I mean, if IComparable or something was implemented... I can not remember...); and not by one of it's property's value. Cause of this, the Selected Value must be empty too (or "none"; so works surely, I didn't tested leaving it empty).
Okey, but this isn't enough; this smart tag was not smart enough. (see picture: "DataBinding to ComboBox - 2.png"). We have to set in the ComboBox's properties (F4), by the (DataBinding) section, the "Text" to (none). This field somehow conflicts with the DisplayMember...
