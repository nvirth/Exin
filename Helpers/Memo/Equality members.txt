RESHARPER - GENERATE - EQUALITY MEMBERS (/COMPARER)

Very helpful, speed up a lot; generates the Equals and GetHashCode fns (overridden).
Notes:
- The Resharperes Equality Comparer generation is not perfect. It does not deal with the base class...
	(worth to generate the IEquatable, and then mimic the Equals and GetHashCode methods from there; because there it's also dealed with the base class)
- We need it by XAML UI models however, because if we don't implement IEquatable in them, we'll get very magic errors in the surface... (this info is the result of 4-5 hours of sufferring)
