Setup meld for git (on Windows)

You need to add the below lines to ~/.gitconfig (which is at c:\Users\<UserName>\.gitconfig in Windows by default)

[merge]
	tool = meld
[mergetool "meld"]
    prompt = false
    keepBackup = true
    keepTemporaries = true
	path = c:/Program Files (x86)/Meld/Meld.exe
[difftool]
	prompt = false
