In those projects, in which we want to be able to run the TransportData in a new process, we need these:
(1) A reference to the TransportData project
(2) In the project file (xxx.csproj) of that project, this have to be exist, for the config file to be reachable after build:
  <Target Name="AfterBuild">
    <Copy SourceFiles="..\Repository\TransportData\bin\$(Configuration)\TransportData.exe.config" 
          DestinationFolder="$(TargetDir)" />
  </Target>

Notes:
* (2) is no more necessary, since TransportData does not contain config file anymore. (2015.12.23)
