The v0.0.4 is the release of the MainSettings.xml and RepoSettings.xml.
No automatic patch has been made for it.
If you want to upgrade an existing v0.0.3 app to v0.0.4, you have to manually patch it.

Used placeholders:
<OldVersionInstallDir> : The installation directory of the old version
<NewVersionInstallDir> : The installation directory of the new version*
<RepoRoot>             : The existing repository's root directory
*Put it first into a separate directory

0. Create a backup of your data and old version app.
1. Manually copy these files:
	<NewVersionInstallDir>/ResourcesDefault/RepoSettings.xml  --> <RepoRoot>/Data/RepoSettings.xml
1.1. If you have your <RepoRoot> under <OldVersionInstallDir>, copy into into <NewVersionInstallDir>
2. You have to extract the values for these xml files:
	<OldVersionInstallDir>/Config/AppSettings.config         <--> <NewVersionInstallDir>/Config/MainSettings.xml
2.1. AppSettings
* Important:
	RepoRootDir <--> MainSettings: App/Repositories/Repo/RootDir
* Others:
	ReadMode <--> RepoSettings: Repo/ReadMode
	SaveMode <--> RepoSettings: Repo/SaveMode
	DbAccessMode <--> RepoSettings: Repo/DbAccessMode
	DbType <--> RepoSettings: Repo/DbType
